User creates Invitation
Invitation is either an open invitation or a specific invitation

In either case, invitation specifies: 
Who goes first (inviter/invitee/let invitee decide/random)
Initial board setup (standard/custom*/random*) *:to be added later
Optional message

Specific invitations have an invitee, open invitations do not

Specific invitations are seen only by the invitee, who may accept or reject it.
Open invitations are seen on an 'open invitations' board, where any user may accept or ignore it
The inviting user can cancel their invitation at any time

When accepting an invitation, if necessary the invitee chooses who goes first (inviter/invitee/random)
At this point, a Game record is created and the invitation record is probably deleted.

Games have a two players, a board state, turn number, and a result (ongoing,white wins via elimination,
white wins via no moves for black, white wins via black conceeding, black wins via elimination,
black wins via no moves for white, black wins via white conceeding, abandoned)
Also add has_many turns, more for record-keeping than anything else.
